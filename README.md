# Tensorflow 2.0 : Horror VS Western

This Python script is an experimentation of mine to classify movie screen capture, making difference between Horror movies and Western movies. A big portion of the code come from Arun Prakash's [Build your own Image classifier with Tensorflow and Keras](https://blog.francium.tech/build-your-own-image-classifier-with-tensorflow-and-keras-dc147a15e38e), adapted for Tensorflow 2.0
